# Combustion Forge

The combustion forge is a multiblock crafting machine that utilizes explosions in order to combine items together. It provides a means of crafting the higher tier items from Explosive Utilities. It also provides some utility recipes that you might find convienent.

## Assembly

To create the combustion forge, you will first need to craft a [combustion forge core.](combustion_forge_core "Combustion Forge Core wiki page")

In addition to the core, you will need the following items:
- 13x Obsidian.
- 9x Furnace.
- 2x Target.
- 1x Dispenser.
- 1x Iron Trapdoor.

Place down the core where you would like to put the forge. Note that it is a 3x3x3 multiblock with the core as it's center.

After up to 10 seconds, the core will display a projection of where to place the blocks at. If any blocks are in the way, a red border will be shown around them. It will look something like this:

Make special note of the placement of the following blocks:
- The iron trapdoor: must be placed on the top of the block. Must also be placed facing away from the forge so that, when it closes, it is flush with the outside of the forge.
- The dispenser: must be placed facing into the forge.
- The furnaces: the orientation of the furnaces does not matter, but it looks nicer if you face the furnaces towards the center of the forge so that their front faces are not visible.

Once the structure is complete, some particles and a sound effect will alert you. It should look something like this:

A similar A/V effect will occur when you break the multiblock.

## Usage

The forge requires tnt as fuel, requiring 1 tnt per activation, which can be fed in through the rear dispenser.

The ingredients in the crafting recipe are to be placed inside the top slot of the furnaces. The furnaces form a 3x3 crafting grid much like in the crafting table. The bottom of the grid lies at the front of the forge, and, conversely, the top lies at the back. 

To activate, assuming it has fuel, close the trapdoor with a redstone signal. While running, the forge will make various sounds and output a redstone signal from the left target block. 

Once the forge is finished and ready to output the result, the sounds will stop and a redstone signal will outputted from the right target block.

To finish the recipe, open the trapdoor once the forge is done. If the trapdoor is opened prior, the items will simply be ejected and no crafting will take place. Note that the resulting explosion will hurt you, especially if you are in front of the forge.

The forge will attempt to make up to 16 items of the specified recipe. Any leftover items in the crafting grid will be ejected from the forge along with the crafted items.
