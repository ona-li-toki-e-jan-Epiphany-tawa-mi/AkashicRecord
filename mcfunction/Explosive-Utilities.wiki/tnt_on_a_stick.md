# Tnt on a Stick

Slapping together a stick, tnt, and a pressure plate creates a highly volatile weapon. Use is not recommended for those who enjoy living.

## Usage

Prep yourself for the coming sweet embrace of death and hit a living or non-living target with the tnt on a stick. 

You will find that, generally, the target will no longer exist afterwards, nor will you.
