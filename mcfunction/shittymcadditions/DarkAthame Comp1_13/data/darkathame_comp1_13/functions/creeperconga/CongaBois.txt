"Hey man, did you hear that [Creeper]s know how to dance?"
That's right, degenerate!, the entity [Creeper] can now form conga lines!

About 100 [Creeper]s can fit in a single line.
If a segment is missing, one takes it's place!
Don't get too close, the dancers in the back may be blind, but they are a bunch of bratty 5 year olds with the fuse of white phosphorus!
That is all.

From u/Sylvaly
