Ay b0ss, seems like you rather unfortunately downloaded dis boy, so lemme explain wuz gunna go down.

This pack contains random things, so it is rather random. 
To enable/disable anything, go into the file [loopcontrol.mcfunction] in [.minecraft/saves/(yourworldhere)/datapacks/Voidpack1_13/data/voidpack1_13/functions] and add/delete hashtags (#) in front of function commands.
Everything is disabled by default.
Or use command blocks, you wuss.
Use [/function voidpack1_13:fullint] to initialize all of it.
Use [/function voidpack1_13:fullunint] to uninitiate all of it.
Expect nothing.
Embrace nothing.
Become nothing.

1. Glowing Chickens (shittymcadditions)
Throw [Glowstone] at a [Chicken] and it will glow, nuff said.

2. Gluttonous Dragon Thing (shittymcadditions)
If you eat food while wearing a [Dragon Head], you will roar.

3. Explosive Pigs (shittymcadditions)
Throwing a piece of [Gunpowder] at a [Pig] will make it explosive, it will detonate upon taking damage, causing an explosion slightly less that of a [Creeper].

4. Fire Fighter Golems (shittymcadditions)
By placing a [Jack o'Lantern] or a [Carved Pumpkin] atop two vertically stacked [Brewing Stand]s will create a [Fire Fighter Golem], these Bois will fire water bottles at hostilities to quench their thirst of getting LEGO star wars onto the moist meter, while also putting out fires along the way.
They are immune to [Fire], and leave no [Snow] trail.

5. Nether Warts (shittymcadditions)
An infection that can be acquired from: 1. Holding [Nether Wart], 2. Standing in [Nether Wart], 3. Standing next to an infected, or 4. Going to a place where and infected had died without waiting.
It takes a bit for exposure to wear off, take care.
Main symptoms include slowness and hardening of the skin.
Warts peel off near the end.
The infected become immune to warts after a infection has run it's full course.
Death while infected will result in a [Wart Cloud] around the point of death.
This [Wart Cloud] is highly infectious and remains for 5 minutes.
Some say that the warts can protect one against fire and lava, though it is possible it is unlikely to happen only at the peak of infection where a host is most immoble, testing this is ill-advised unless proper safety equipment is present

6. Nuclear Weapons (To-Do)

7. Natural Disaster (To-Do)

8. Creeper Marching Band (Incomplete)

9. Black Holes
So, you wanna destroy the world?, well I can't do that, BUT I can slow your server down to a snail's pace!!!11!
As-for now, typing /function voidpack1_13:blackhole/giveblackhole will give you a spawner.
These bad bois are rotating, that means that things come in an angle as they are pushed by the Ergosphere.
They'll kill anything.
One feature of the Ergosphere is that it dilates time! (To-Do)
Please be warned that the blackhole functions are fragile and unstable, too many entities within it's pull and it slows any server tick-rate to a halt, use at your own (and other's) risk.
The special quirk(s) is(are): 
Primed TNT that enters the event horizon will cause an explosion roughly 2.3x the power of a normal explosion.

10. Ebic Killls
You wanna be an ebic gamer like CallMeCarson?, while just you wait!, this gamer filled adventure adds some wAcKy kill messages to allow the gamer within to shine!
It says stuff when you kill things.
Inspired when in one of CallMeCarson's minecraft streams where he said "I just got an EPIC kill."
