# multiply-by-n - Haskell-Gloss

This is the Haskell implementation of multiply-by-n using Gloss to generate graphics.


## How to run

You will need ghc 9.2.8, cabal, and stack installed on your system. I recommend using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup "GHCup homepage.") to install them if not present.

Run the following command(s) in the Haskell-Gloss directory:

```console
stack run
```
