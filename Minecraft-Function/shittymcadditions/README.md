I don't like this, and I will never touch it again.

If you do want to use it:

Put [DarkAthame Comp1_13] into your Datapacks folder and use what files that you want in there.

Use the hashtags to enable/disable functions in the Master Loop.

Some files may have a Int (install) and a Unint (uninstall) function file, these are used to activate/deactivate things like scoreboards, so make sure to use them!

If individually installing scoreboards isn't your gig then you can use [/function darkathame_comp1_13:massint] or [/function darkathame_comp1_13:massunint] to do it all at once.

All modules have a .txt explaining what they do (sometimes), who suggested the idea, and any non-function files they use, mainly .json files.

Now with advancements!
