If You Want To Crossbreed Actual Mobs You Will Need To Force Them Into A Small Space.
Any Cross-Bred Entites Will Be Unable To Crossbreed Again For 5 Minutes But Can Still Undergo Normal Breeding Habits. 


By Throwing ONE Carrot Atop A Pumpkin And Waiting, A Parrot Will Form!

By Feeding A Wolf Normally And Giving A Villager A ONE Emerald By Tossing It At Him, This Will Make A New Mob, The Furliger!
The Furliger Will Sell 2 Coarse Dirt For Just 7 Rotten Flesh!, They Will Also Drop Their Fursuit Headpiece As It Is Quite A Needed Addition.

By Feeding A Dolphin ONE Fish By Tossing It And A Cow Normally In A Very Close Space It Will Make A New Mob, The Sea Cow.
He Just Floats About, But Still Pretty Cool; Drops Cod And Leather.

And Of Course!~
BORIS JOHNSON!
Now I'm Not Sure If This Is The One You Want, But The Boris I Looked Up Is Some Kind Of European Political Figure.
You Get Em' By Feeding A Polar Bear ONE Fish By Tossing It And A Pig Normally In VERY CLOSE QUARTERS.
He Says Some Cool Stuff Like "piccaninnies", Give That Word A Look Up ;).
