# bungusmacs

My super-epic-califristic-expiallidocious Emacs configuration.

Take a look inside `init.el` for an overview on what features it has.

## Installation

If you would like to install bungusmacs yourself for whatever reason, simply
clone the files of this repository into the directory `~/.emacs.d` on your
system and reload Emacs. Then, check `init.el` for any post-install
instructions.
