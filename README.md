# AkashicRecord

The history of my universe, I guess.

This repository stores a good chunk of the code, circuits, and other things I've
written and designed that don't deserve their own project. It's for safe
keeping.  Feel free to browse!

Be aware that much of the code here is hot garbage and probably non-functional.
