# AkashicRecord

This monolithic repository stores a good chunk of the code, circuits, and other
things I've written and designed that don't deserve their own project or were
abandoned.  It's for safe keeping. Feel free to browse!

All code here falls under the MIT license located in the root directory of this
project unless stated otherwise (which will sometimes be stated otherwise.)
