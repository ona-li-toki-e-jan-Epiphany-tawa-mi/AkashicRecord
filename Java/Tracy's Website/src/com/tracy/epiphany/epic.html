    /* So this is a cool animation and all, but how does it work?
 * Quite simply!, but I'm going to explain the math in a confusing way so it is harder for you to understand.
 *
 * First, to avoid clutter and confusion, let theta = a, where theta is an input angle that's used to draw points.
 * We can draw circles using the coordinate set, (cos(a), sin(a)), to draw circles thanks to the relation trigonometry has with the unit circle.
 * This draws them clockwise, but that looked lame so I drew them counter-clockwise using the inverse, (sin(a), cos(a)).
 * The size of this circle can be increased by multiplying both coordinates by some number, s, which looks like this: (sin(a)*s, cos(a)*s).
 * Now for every point we do this for, we make another point using (sin(a*n), cos(a*n)), where n is some multiplier we increment every interval at which the program runs.
 * We then draw a line from the orignal point, (sin(a), cos(a)), to the new one, (sin(a*n), cos(a*n)).
 * This process is iterated over for the number of points selected, p.
 * The angle a is determined and incremented by Δa, where Δa = 360 / p, we do this to find out how much we need to space out every point to keep them even.
 * From this chaotic and relatively simple operation that is run every few milliseconds, complex shapes arises, such as cardioids and shuriken-like figures
 *
 * TL;DR, we take one point, multiply it's "x" value, and draw a line from the orginal point to the new multiplied point. We then do this for hundreds of points, thousands of times per second.
