# ISawedThisPlayerInHalf!

Your player... is ca- oh my god, his torso is flying!

This mod splits apart the player, freeing the torso from the legs.

## How to Use

These chat commands allow you to control your offsets, the new position of the
torso, in-game.

* Help: **::offsets help**
* Set offsets: **::offsets set \<x> \<y> \<z>**
* Reset offsets: **::offsets reset**
* Print out offsets (defaults to self): **::offsets get [player name]**

::ofs can be used in place of ::offsets.

Offsets can also be modified using the config file (in
`config/isawedthisplayerinhalf-client.toml`)

## Multiplayer

The mod must also be on the server for multiplayer-compatibility.

I would **_not_** recommend using this on a server that does not have the mod.

Server owners can change which language that ISawedThisPlayerInHalf! displays
information in using the config file (in
`config/isawedthisplayerinhalf-server.toml`).
