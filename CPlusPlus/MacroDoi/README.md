A [new version](https://github.com/ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi/MacroDoi/tree/master "New version of MacroDoi") is in development/avalible (although it will be/is completely different.)

# MacroDoi
I was watching an episode of the office with my mom. In the episode, Jim puts a macro on Dwight's computer.
I thought it would be nice to have some macros on my computer, and I also thought it would be kinda funny to use it against someone.

So, I made a macro program. The program loads macros in from a text file. The file has to be named macros.txt, and it must be in the same directory-level.

All macros come in this form: *activatorName: parameter1; parameter2; ... parameterN | executorName: parameter1; parameter2; ... parameterN*

At the moment, only key macros are implemented.

Check the [wiki](./MacroDoi.wiki/Home.md "MacroDoi wiki homepage English") for details.
